This project took a look at the challenges that new technologies had to overcome in detecting EMG signals. Also exploring the challenges in machine learning and how these signals can be trained and used for gestural control applications. The EMG signal has been around back as far as the 1960’s, with its first uses in healthcare. As the signal became more popular in various exploratory programs and valuable<br>research conducted, a widespread field of opportunities<br>was unleashed.<br><br>This project also took a look at the challenges with machine learning, using wekinator and the myo armband. These two technologies along with the EMG signal worked together to show these challenges during the machine learning process, and some possibilities to<br>overcome them. Machine learning has become quiet popular in recent years with the development of new technologies such as wekinator and weka. This project will focus on the process on how to train gestures using wekinator and training data, along with signal processing techniques for the EMG signal.</p>

The goal was to explore the EMG signal using the Myo armband and to look at the challenges with signal processing and machine learning. The project looked at different types of training data, along with different machine learning algorithms that are available with Wekinator for model evaluation. It was shown that when conducting a direct evaluation the (Naive Bayes) algorithm was best suited, and when conducting a cross model evaluation (K - Nearest Neighbour) was best suited. <br><br>The data research conducted in this project could be useful for someone conducting future projects in the machine learning field using EMG signals as training data. We now know what data is suitable and unsuitable for machine learning, and also what signal processing techniques are best suited to the EMG signal.<br><br>My goal was to create a musical application in max and to use the model learned by Wekinator to control various parameters of the application. Unfortunately the system was never built and the focus was driven more towards the machine learning process, so that part of the project never got a  chance to shine, but defiantly something I would consider for future projects. <br><br>Recommendations for future research I would suggest tasking a look at Training for more then five gestures, and to experiment with other exploratory programs such as PD, Arduino and Abelton Live for musicians working with musical applications. Machine learning has become a very popular topic over the last number of years, and is being used in various exploratory programs such musical field for live musical performances, the biomedical field, and the technology and education field, the possibility’s are endless and still growing.&nbsp;</p>

The system is split up into three different sections which include the recording and storage of the data, data processing and communication between max and wekinator over open sound control (OSC). Three different gestures with over ten variations of each were recorded which were used as training data for wekinator. The myo armband had to be placed in the exact same location on the arm during the whole process.<br><br>Various different tests were conducted using multiple signal processing techniques and testing various algorithms for different model types during the training stages of the machine learning process. Tests were conducted to determine the most efficient machine learning process while training with raw, filtered and multiple input data types, and to monitor the difference in behaviour and the outputs from the gestures.<br></p>

The groups were split up into different parts for example, the options were doing a desk demo, installation, sound and research. Many students who chose installations were located down in the Csis atrium, or were assigned a room to set up. Students who choose sound, also and the option to have an installation, each project is different so their were different circumstance for each student. <br><br>For my own FYM exhibition I chose to display my work in a lab on the iMacs located in the Csis as a desk demo. After quiet a a lot of brainstorming and visualising what my demo day would look like, a desk demo in the lab was the best option for me. I was located on the third floor mac lab located in the Csis building. For my exhibition I chose to show how the entire machine learning process using EMG signals as inputs from the Myo armband to create training models for machine learning. My aim was to explain the entire process to whoever was interested over the course of the day, including my supervisor and second reader. <br><br>I chose this method of presentation because it seemed like the most appropriate way to showcase my work, without having to much going on at once. The computer screen and desk space was plenty big enough to show off the max patches I created at also hang my FYP power which has all the information about the project, the research conducted and the purpose of the project and what it was trying to achieve.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br>Technical Skills:<br>Digital electronics <br>
